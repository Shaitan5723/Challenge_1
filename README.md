The purpose of this task is to refactor the code of a client's webpage to make it more accessible. The final product should resemble the initial product in a web browser; the only differences are made in the code. 

Initial product:
!initial product(https://github.com/Shaitan5723/Challenge_1/blob/main/assets/images/initial_prod.png)

Code used: HTML & CSS

Work done:

In order to ensure accessibility standards are met, the HTML elements must be semantic.
I replaced the various <div> elements with proper corrsponding semantic elements, ie. <article>.

Added alt attributes to all icon and image elements.

The initial product did not have a title for the webpage, so one was added.

Comments added to both HTML and CSS files to describe each element and selector and what they do.

Cleaned up HTML and CSS code
  - fixed nav link
  - combined repetative classes for cleaner CSS code

Final Product:
!final product(/assets/images/final_prod.png)
